## **ATTENTION:** We are currently working on version 2 which is based on Spring-Shell to be more user-friendly and easy to use. So the master branch might seem empty, but to view the code of version 1.0 please follow this link: [archive/version_1.0](https://github.com/arVahedi/Gl4dius/releases/tag/archive%2Fversion_1.0)

## Features : 
- Deface attack on the whole LAN network
- Phishing attack
- Sniffing attack
- SSL downgrade attack (**SSL-Stripping**)
- Bypass **HSTS** protection
- Cover your track from discovery methods automatically. (**Be Careful**: No guarantee that you will be 
invisible completely. A hacker who understands MITM attacks deeply can still hunt you. But it will be very difficult for normal 
people or script kiddies to track you.) 

**Note:** If you are a script kiddie please don't try to use this tool. Anyway, it will not work for you. (I guarantee that!)

## Dependencies : 

- iptables or pf (iptables is recommended)
- jre >= 1.8

## How to use : 

Use the config file for configuring the tool, and select the kind of attack and other properties.
after that, you can simply run the tool like other Java programs.

(I wrote imperfect documentation deliberately, to prevent script kiddies from using this tool. 
If you are a grand master hacker accept my apologies, Of course, you can use this tool with little R&D.)
