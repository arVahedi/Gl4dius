## Features : 
- deface attack on whole LAN network
- Phishing attack
- Sniffing attack
- SSL downgrade attack (**SSL-Stripping**)
- Bypass **HSTS** protection
- Cover your track from discovery methods automatically. (**Be Careful** : No guarantee that you will be 
invisible completely. A hacker who understand MITM attacks deeply, can hunt you yet. But it will be very difficult for normal 
people or script kiddies to track you.) 

**Note :** If you are a script kiddie please don't try to use this tool. Anyway it will not work for you. (I guarantee that!)

## Dependencies : 

- iptables or pf (iptables is recommended)

## How to use : 

Use the config file for config tool, select kind of attack, and other properties.
after that you can simply run tool like other java programs.

(I wrote a imperfect documentation Deliberately, to prevent script kiddies to use this tool. 
If you are a grand master hacker accept my apologies, of course you can use this tool with little R&D.)
